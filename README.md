# Neural-Network-based-metamodel
This repository contains the code associated with the paper titled "Neural Network-Based Metamodel of synthetic seismograms: Application for uncertainty quantification." This paper explores the use of neural networks as surrogate models to predict synthetic seismograms derived from solving the three-dimensional equation of motion, in both time and frequency domains. These surrogate models are designed to predict either time series or frequency series outputs based on the input variables of a physical model, aiming to quantify epistemic uncertainty in ground motion predictions.
Note: For simplicity, this repository includes only the code for predicting time series outputs. The frequency domain model code is not included here.
Repository Structure
The repository is organized into two main directories:

Reference-Station/: This directory contains code and data for predicting signals at the reference station. The data generated by the EFISPEC3D code is divided into:
Training Set: For model training.
Validation Set: For model validation.
Inputs: The input parameters corresponding to each set.
Model: A trained model file, best_model_epoch_179.h5, which predicts signals in the EW (East-West) direction for the reference station.

Site-Station/: This directory contains code and data for predicting signals at the site station, with a similar structure:
Training Set: For model training.
Validation Set: For model validation.
Inputs: The input parameters corresponding to each set.
Model: A trained model file, best_model_epoch_197.h5, which predicts signals in the EW (East-West) direction for the site station.

Model Prediction
To predict the signals in the EW direction using neural networks, a Python script "test-best-model.py is provided. This script loads the trained models:

best_model_epoch_179.h5 for the reference station
best_model_epoch_197.h5 for the site station
These models predict ground motion signals in the EW direction based on the input variables of the physical model.

Novelty
This work introduces a novel application by using neural network techniques to develop a surrogate model for seismic simulations. This approach demonstrates that neural networks can be effectively trained to approximate complex physical simulation outputs in the time domain.
